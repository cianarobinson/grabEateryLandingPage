          <p>GRAB Eatery was born out of our desire to make good, healthy food accessible to everyone, and to break the cycle of diet related diseases in our families and community. 
         We started our journey in February 2012 with a meal delivery and catering company which served the greater Downtown Detroit area. The response was overwhelming!</p>
